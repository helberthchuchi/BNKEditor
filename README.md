# BNKEditor

A tool to edit the sounds inside an Audiokinetic Wwise SoundBank, without modifying the additional information in the SoundBank.

## Installation

To run this program, you need Java. Check [here](https://java.com/en/download/installed8.jsp) if you already have Java installed.

## Usage

First of course you need to open a SoundBank.

Once you opened one, you are presented with a list of all the sounds inside it. You have the choice to extract singular sounds, extract all sounds at once, or most importantly, replace singular sounds.

The file you intend to replace a sound with will be showed next to the "replace" button. If you have made a mistake, you can cancel the replacement.

Make sure that the file you open for replacement is compatible with the version of Wwise the game you're trying to mod uses.

Once you have made all the changes you want to make, hit "save BNK as ..." and choose a location to save your modified SoundBank.

Just about all I know about the BNK format, I know from reading this page: [wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Wwise_SoundBank_(*.bnk)](http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/Wwise_SoundBank_(*.bnk))
